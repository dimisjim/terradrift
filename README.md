# terradrift
A tool that will navigate through all terraform directories (stacks) to run terraform plan to detect the current drift between the committed code and applied infrastructure.

As weâ€™re adding/modifying infrastructure pieces, sometimes we encounter a few terraform stacks (directory) that are drifting from the current infrastructure. Thatâ€™s mainly caused by changes done manually or resources deleted as theyâ€™re no longer needed without any track on our code base. 

Some of these changes have been done for testing purposes and then forgotten, or have been sitting there for a longer period that the responsible team has lost the track

## Installation / Deployment
The design of the service should be a running server that continuously runs those drift scans.
### Configurations
In [config.yaml](config.yaml), you have to define which repository that terradrift will scan those stacks from, also the stack's name, version and environment-specific variables.
example:
```yaml
repository: "https://github.com/rootsami/terrad-examples"
stacks:
  - name: stack-one
    version: 1.0.6
    path: gcp/stack-one

  - name: stack-three
    version: 1.2.5
    path: gcp/stack-multi
    tfvars: environments/three.tfvars
    backend: environments/three.hcl
```

Also, you will have export `GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN` as an environment variable to be able to checkout private repositories.

## How to develop/use terradrift locally?
After setting up the configs in the above section
```bash
# go build
# ./terradrift 
```
It will start a local HTTP server on `http://localhost:8080`, where you can initiate terradrift calls HTTP request and passing stackname in the URL. 
```bash
# curl http://localhost:8080/api/plan?stack=stack-one
"CHANGES DETECTED... Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy."

# curl http://localhost:8080/api/plan?stack=stack-three
"No changes. Infrastructure matches the configuration."
```

## Roadmap
This tool started as a fun project by Cumulus, but then it got INTERESTING! ðŸ¤© 

- Scheduled runs for all defined stacks.
- Once drift is detected, then what? For how long?
- Optimizations: No download/install for each run. it has to be once.
